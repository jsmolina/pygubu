Welcome to pygubu a GUI designer for tkinter
============================================

Pygubu is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user interfaces
for the python tkinter module.

The user interfaces designed are saved as XML, and by using the pygubu builder
these can be loaded by applications dynamically as needed.
Pygubu is inspired by Glade.

Installation
============

Pygubu requires python >= 2.6 (Tested only in python 2.6 and 3.2.3 with tk8.5)

Using zip tarball:

Download and extract the tarball. Open a console in the extraction path
 and execute:

```
python setup.py install
```

Using pip:

```
pip install pygubu
```


Usage
=====

Create an UI definition using pygubu-designer and save it to a file.

[helloworld.ui] (examples/helloworld.ui)

Then, create
your aplication script as shown below:

```python
#test.py
import Tkinter as tk
import pygubu


class Application:
    def __init__(self, master):

        #1: Create a builder
        self.builder = builder = pygubu.Builder()

        #2: Load an ui file
        builder.add_from_file('helloworld.ui')

        #3: Create the widget using a master as parent
        self.mainwindow = builder.get_object('mainwindow', master)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = Application(root)
    root.mainloop()
```
